# Bouncy Balls

Dynamic tag to render on-click bouncing balls on any web page

## Usage

Include `bouncy.min.js` on any page:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tiagosiebler/BouncingBalls@1.0.1/dist/bouncy.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Click anywhere to render bouncing balls.

## Build

The build process is managed via webpack. To run it:
- Install dependencies: `npm i --dev`
- Run build process: `npm run build`

The optimised output can be found in the `dist` folder.

## Workflow
Once the script is loaded on any page, a canvas tag is dynamically rendered within the page body.
